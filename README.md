# Evora Floor Demo (Ready to Run)

Open `index.html` in a browser. If you see a grid, use **Încarcă imagine** to load your `floor.png`.

## Features
- Floating toolbar overlay (top-left)
- Sticky left sidebar (filters + Active list)
- Hover/click highlights between dots & list
- Click a dot to open editable details (last checked, approved, tag, type)
- 5 forklifts + 5 lifters simulated at ~5 km/h with waypoints
- Extinguishers rendered as dots (green/red)

## Notes
- Data is bundled (`data/`), but you can swap with your own.
- For best results, serve via a local server (or allow local file access).
